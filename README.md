# NimbusPulse SDK

The NimbusPulse SDK provides developers with a set of tools and interfaces to interact programmatically with the NimbusPulse platform, which is a DCS (Digital Combat Simulator) server hosting solution. Using this SDK, developers can easily integrate NimbusPulse functionalities into their applications, enabling automation, management, and monitoring of DCS server instances.

## Features

- **Server Management:** Create, start, stop, and configure DCS servers directly from your application.
- **Automation:** Automate server tasks such as mission rotations and server monitoring.
- **Monitoring:** Retrieve server metrics and logs for better insights into performance.
- **Multi-language Support:** Designed to work with multiple programming languages.

## Supported Languages

| Language     | Status                             |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| JavaScript   | Minimal                            |
| Rust         | Minimal                            |

## Support Level Definitions
 - Minimal   : Basic functionality is operational (Create, Start, Stop, Delete)
 - Functional: Core features are complete with additional settings and customizations available.
 - Complete  : All features are fully implemented, including advanced functionality like runtime with live player count, chat, and more.

> **Note:** As of now, both JavaScript (with TypeScript support) and Rust versions of the SDK are under active development. Future versions will include more language support and fully stable SDKs.
